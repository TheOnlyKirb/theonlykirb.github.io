# Welcome

This is the repo for my public facing website/blog `theonlykirb.github.io` and `ajnicoloff.me`

### Why make it public?

Various reasons, but mostly because I don't see a need to keep it private, if someone wanted to copy it they could regardless of my choice

### PR "Rules"
- I'd like to keep this as personal of a site as possible, without a ton of other's input
- The only exception to the above is if you are a close friend and you let me credit you appropriately
- If you make a PR to the Discord.JS code section of my site, please include the reasoning for the change.
- If I happen to be working on something already tailored to what your PR includes, I will most likely close it, please don't take offense to this!
- PR Content/ PR Language must be in English.

### Other Things
- The content I post on this blog/website is under copyright as my own intelectual property- this means unless it is explicitly stated, you may not copy it or reword it to post on your own site.
- Code in the Tutorials I may post is all free use, and fair game, the above only refers to my posts, and specific pages/tutorial writings.
