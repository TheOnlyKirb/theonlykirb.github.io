# Welcome!

This is my new github pages website/blog. I'll be posting about interesting websites I find, new open source projects, and anything I find worthy to be discussed.

I aim for this to also be a hub for tutorials I write, and any code I decide to make free-to-use, and in general a place for me to toss my thoughts out online.

You are also probably wondering why it looks like it was made in the early 2000s, and why the cursor is a flame - the answer is, well- because I can.

I don't believe the web has to be this modern chic look where all sites become indistinquishable from one another. If you want to have fun with your site, you absolutely can, and I encourage you to try it yourself- get out of the mindset that modern is always good, and "Material Design" is the best design.


Hope you enjoy!
