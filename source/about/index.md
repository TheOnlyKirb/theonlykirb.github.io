**Short:** 18, like to mess with code, also dabble in other things


**Long:** I'm a 18 year old Sophomore at the College of Charleston with an interest in Application Development, Cybersecurity, and a lot more. I've been working with code since I was 13 and had access to a 7 inch windows tablet with a bluetooth keyboard and mouse, so you can say I'm a total pro by now. Jokes aside, I'm interested in many different aspects and intricacies of technology and aspects of the internet.

**Favorite Language:** Gotta say, I love Javascript/NodeJS
