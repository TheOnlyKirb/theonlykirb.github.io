**You've made it!** You've joined Discord and now you want to spice things up a bit and create a Discord Bot, perhaps this is even your first time working with NodeJS, or even _your first time writing code at all._

**Before** we get started, I'd like to mention that before you create a public application, or even a private one - you should have at _the very least_ a basic understanding of how the language you are using works. You can't write code without knowing the basics.

If you are wanting to hop right into making a bot, I **strongly advise** that you visit the following websites to learn some of the basics first:
- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/default.asp)
- [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-node-js)
- [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/)

I'm going to hope you listened, and at least _skimmed_ the basics on the sites above.

## Setting up the Environment

**Before** you can get started with anything, you need to make sure your environment is setup correctly. By this, I mean you need to make sure that your desktop, or laptop - has the programs required to code, and run code with NodeJS.

If you haven't already, install the following:
- [NodeJS 12+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
_**Note:**_ _We will be using Visual Studio Code for this tutorial, but feel free to use any code editor you like._
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

Once you have those installed, proceed with the steps below!

WIP, if you are already on my site, wow okay that was fast, and also, howdy, come back later! I'm working on this frequently!
